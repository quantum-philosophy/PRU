Machine-learning techniques have been extensively utilized for aiding the design
of computer systems. However, as it was noted in \sref{introduction}, the recent
advancements in machine learning have not been sufficiently explored yet in this
context.

The work in \cite{dabbagh2015} is concerned with cloud data centers, and it
presents a framework for predicting the number of user requests along with the
required amount of \up{CPU} and memory. The framework relies on k-means
clustering for identifying different types of requests. It then uses a
stochastic Wiener filter in order to estimate the workload for each identified
type.

In \cite{ismaeel2015}, the authors focus on forecasting user requests of a cloud
data center and propose a framework based on extreme learning machines, which
are feed-forward neural networks. Similar to \cite{dabbagh2015}, k-means
clustering is undertaken beforehand.

Aimed at predicting the \up{CPU} usage in a cloud environment, an ensemble model
is presented in \cite{cao2014}. It relies on multiple models including an
exponential smoothing, auto regressive, weighted nearest neighbors, and most
similar pattern model. The final predictions are obtained by combing the
predictions from these models by means of a scoring algorithm.

To conclude, only primitive architectures of neural networks have been
considered, and they have been applied to relatively simple tasks at relatively
small scales. Consequently, there is a palpable need for further exploration.
