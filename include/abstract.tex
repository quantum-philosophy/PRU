In this paper, we investigate the utility of the state-of-the-art
machine-learning techniques in the context of fine-grained long-range prediction
of the resource usage in a computer cluster. To this end, a large data set of
resource-usage traces collected and published by Google is considered. We devise
and describe in detail our workflow, starting for the processing of the data and
finishing by making multiple-step-ahead predictions of the resource usage of
individual work units. The experimental results indicate that the considered
data is not deprived of a certain structure, which can be used for making
educated predictions.
