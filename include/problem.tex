Consider a cluster of computers that are serving a stream of tasks which are
distributed across the cluster by a resource manager. Each task consumes certain
resources during its execution; examples include the \up{CPU} and memory usage
over time. The cluster has an adequate monitoring facility deployed so that the
resource usage of the tasks is at one's disposal.
