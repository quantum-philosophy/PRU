Our work makes the following contribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item We present a pipeline for working with a large data set that makes the
data readily accessible for machine-learning undertakings. We consider the
resource-usage traces published by Google \cite{reiss2011} as our case study.

\item We present a strategy for learning and fine-grained long-range prediction
of resource usage that relies on the state-of-the-art machine-learning
techniques.

\item We open-source the infrastructure that we have developed for data
processing and machine learning \cite{sources}.
\end{itemize}
