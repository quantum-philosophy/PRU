Our work makes the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item We present a pipeline for working with a large data set that makes the
data readily accessible for machine-learning undertakings, and we apply it to a
data set of real resource-usage traces collected in a large computer cluster.

\item We present a strategy for learning and fine-grained long-range prediction
of resource usage that relies on the state-of-the-art machine-learning
techniques.

\item We open-source the infrastructure that we have developed for data
processing and machine learning \cite{sources}.
\end{itemize}

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to investigate the utility
of recurrent neural networks for predicting the resource usage in a computer
cluster. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to
address this prediction at the level of individual tasks executed in the
cluster.
