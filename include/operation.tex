The output of the data-processing stage described in \sref{data} is the data set
$X$, which is split into three catalogs of TFRecord files (for training,
validation, and testing).

\subsection{Training}
In our experiments, we use the Adam optimizer \cite{kingma2014}.

\subsection{Validation}
To this end, we use Hyperband \cite{li2016}.

\subsection{Testing}
In order to have a long-range prediction (multiple steps ahead), we use
refeeding: the predicted value $\hat{x}_{i,k + 1}$ is fed into the model as if
it was the actual resource usage $x_{i,k + 1}$ at step $k + 1$, which is not
yet known at time step $k$. The process continues until all the desired $h$
future values are estimated.
