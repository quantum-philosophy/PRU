The experiments were conducted on a \up{GNU}/Linux machine equipped with 16
processors Intel Xeon \up{E5520} 2.27~GHz, 24~\up{GB} of \up{RAM}, and an
\up{HDD}. No \up{GPU}s were utilized.

\subsection{Data Processing}
The grouping and indexing operations that are described in \sref{grouping} and
\sref{indexing}, respectively, took approximately 60 hours (no parallelism was
used internally). Most of this time was spent converting \up{CSV} into SQLite,
which could have been avoided by working with \up{CSV} directly. However, SQLite
provided a convenient way for working with the data. Moreover, since these
operations have to be done only once, their computational cost can be safely
neglected.
