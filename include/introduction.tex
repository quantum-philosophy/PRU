Over the last decade, the field of machine learning has received a great amount
of due attention from both inside and outside of the field. This interest is
chiefly ascribed to the renaissance in the development of neural networks
\cite{goodfellow2016}.

Neural networks seemingly effortlessly superseded the back-then state-of-the-art
techniques for modeling the structure of given data and subsequently
characterizing unseen, predicting future, or generating similar data points. Due
to its flexibility and scalability, the technique has become a strong catalyst
for the development of other disciplines such as computer vision, speech
recognition, and natural language processing.

The design of computer systems has also seen some applications of neural
networks; we shall touch upon them in \sref{literature}. However, the research
in this direction has been rather limited. Only primitive architectures of
neural networks have been considered, and they have been applied to relatively
simple tasks at relatively small scales. This state of affairs is unfortunate
provided that the machinery of neural networks has been nearly revolutionary in
other disciplines.

We feel strongly that more research should be conducted in order to investigate
the aid that the recent advancements in machine learning could give to the
design of computer systems. In this paper, we set out to conduct one such body
of research. Namely, we study the resource usage in a computer cluster and aim
to predict this usage using recurrent neural networks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:literature}
provides an overview of the prior work. Our contribution is summarized in
\sref{contribution}. In \sref{problem}, the problem that we address is
formulated. Our pipeline for data processing is presented in \sref{data}, and
our predictive model in \sref{model}. The key operational aspects of our
workflow are described in \sref{operation}. The experimental results are
reported and discussed in \sref{result}. Finally, \sref{conclusion} concludes
the paper.
