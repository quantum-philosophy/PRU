The output of the data-processing stage is three catalogs of TFRecord files (for
training, validation, and testing).

A schematic representation of the model can be seen in \fref{model}. Let us now
describe each part of the model in detail.

\subsection{Input}
She sells seashells on the seashore.

\subsection{Recurrent Layers}
We use recurrent neural networks \cite{goodfellow2016}.

\subsection{Fully Connected Layer}
She sells seashells on the seashore.

\subsection{Output}
She sells seashells on the seashore.
