Our work makes the following contribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item We present an efficient pipeline for processing large data sets so that
they are readily accessible for machine-learning undertakings. We consider the
Google cluster-usage traces \cite{reiss2011} as an illustrative example.

\item We present an efficient infrastructure for training and fine-grained
long-range prediction of the resource usage in a computer cluster. To this end,
we employ the state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques.
\end{itemize}
Needless to mention that all our code is open source and publicly available; it
can be found online at \cite{sources}.
